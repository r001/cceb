### Interact with exchanges

Using `cceb` all basic exchange function can be executed including deposit, and withdraw funds. Add, remove, list orders, get orderbook, show a price of a token, and show available token pairs(markets).

#### Deposit tokens

Get deposit address for tokens on an exchange. 

##### Examples

Get deposit address for Ether on Binance:  
`$ cceb exchange deposit binance ETH`

##### Details `cceb exchange deposit`
```
$ cceb exchange deposit --help
usage: cceb exchange deposit [-h] exchange token

Get deposit address of token for exchange.

Positional arguments:
  exchange    Name of exchange.
  token       Token to deposit.

Optional arguments:
  -h, --help  Show this help message and exit.
```

#### Add order

Orders can be added on centralized exchanges like Binance, and on decentralized ones using the same syntax.

When stating amount, any javascript accepted mathematical expression can be used with the symbol of `max`, meaning 'maximum possible amount'.   
Add order buying Ether for half of the USDT we have at a limit price of 1500:  
`$ cceb exchange add binance buy limit max/2 ETH/USDT 1500`  
  
Sell all the WBTC we have (note we just set a price of 0, as it is ignored anyway when adding market orders):  
`$ cceb exchange add uniswap sell market max WBTC/USDT 0`  

##### Examples

Add buy limit order of amount of 1 BTC at price 55000:  
`$ cceb exchange add coinbasepro buy limit 1 BTC/USDT 55000`  
  
Add buy market order of amount of 15 BTC at price 55000 (note price ignored adding market orders):  
`$ cceb exchange add binance buy market 15 BTC/USDT 0`

```
#### Trickle

Using trickle `cceb` will create multiple orders or random sizes, random times apart when price reaches a threshold value.  

Trickle feature can be used in two cases:
- Buy/sell a large amount of tokens, in many small batches.
- Emulate limit order on Uniswap (that does not support it). It works only with accounts with private key provided, where `cceb` can actually sign the transaction when necessary.

##### Examples

Sell a large stack of CRV token adding multiple orders automatically.  
Sell on Binance 2090.46 CRV token in batches ranging from 0 to 1000 CRV, with random timeout between 120-240 seconds between successful orders, and put orders there only if price is greater or equal to 4:  
`$ cceb trickle binance sell market 2090.46936856 CRV/USDT 0 -s 0 -v 1000 -t 120 -r 120 -m 4`
  
Emulate limit order on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap):  
Add limit order on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap) selling 11 MKR for 77000 DUCK tokens. Do this from ETH-MY account, with batch size of 11 MKR, price 1000, wait 300 seconds between retries if order does not succeed, and 10 seconds between successful orders (makes no sense here), batch time variance is 0, and send the resulting DUCK tokens to ETH-TO address:  
`$ cceb exchange trickle uniswap sell market 11 MKR/DUCK 0 --from ETH-MY -s 11 -m 7000 -y 300 -t 10 -r 0 -o ETH-TO`

### [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) blockchain interactions

When interacting with Ethereum contracts, `cceb` returns fixed digits (decimals fitted for each token) numbers when `balanceOf`, or `totalSupply` is requested. When numbers are entered to `cceb eth tx` then dot is disregarded, and number is taken as an integer. So make sure you DO NOT delete any digits from fractional numbers.
  
From address is not needed, because if not provided `cceb` will use default address defined in `config/default.yaml -> web3.defaultFrom`  
  
There are three types of Ethereum accounts can be defined in `config/secrets/default.yaml -> web3.account`:
- `privatekey` - UNSAFE!!! the privatekey is stored  in `config/secrets/default.yaml web3.account.<account_name>.privatekey`. If the file gets compromised, attacker has total authority on account.
- `airsign` - (SAFE) [airsign](https://github.com/r001/airsign) accounts store the privatekeys on a mobile phone that communicates `cceb` using QR codes to sign transactions and signatures. 
- `ledger` - (SAFE) [ledger](https://www.ledger.com) accounts use Ledger cold wallets to sign transactions

#### Send or call ethereum contracts

##### Examples

Check the balance of [Compound](https://compound.finance/) account:  
`$ cceb eth tx DAI balanceOf 0x5d3a536e4d6dbd6114cc1ead35777bab948e3643`  
  
Check Ether balance of account (contract address is the WETH contract):  
`$ cceb eth tx ETH balanceOf 0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2`  
(Note that same syntax can be for Ether as for any [ERC20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) tokens. But of course the original functions can be used too.)  
  
Check Ether balance of account:  
`$ cceb eth tx ETH balance 0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2`  
(Note this time we use the function defined for Ether.)  
  
Get exchange address for pair on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap):   
`$cceb eth tx UNISWAP_FACTORY getPair DAI WETH`  
  
###### Add liquidity to [Curve](https://www.curve.fi)
Let's assume 62000 USDT will be deposited to 3POOL on Curve.  
  
First approve SWAP contract for token you want to deposit:  
`$ cceb eth tx USDT approve CRV_SWAP_3POOL`  
  
Then check which argument of the next function is USDT token:  
`$ cceb eth tx CRV_SWAP_3POOL coins 2`  
  
Then add liquidity to pool (as USDT is the third token, in the array the third value will represent it).  
Add 62000 USDT to 3POOL requiring a minimum of 61000 LP tokens.  
`$ cceb eth tx CRV_SWAP_3POOL add_liquidity '["0","0","62000.000000"]' 61000.000000000000000000`  
(Note that the USDT has 6 decimal precision, but the minimum requied LP token is 18 digit precision.)   
  
Lets check if we really got the LP tokens:  
`$ cceb eth tx CRV_LP_3POOL balanceOf ETH-MY-ACC`  
(Lets assume we got 61234.560000000000000000 LP tokens.)  
(Note we assume that ETH-MY-ACC is listed in `config/secrets/default.yaml -> web3: -> account:` and has a valid address.)  
  
Let's put that LP token to the gauge to receive CRV payment:  
`$ cceb eth tx CRV_GAUGE_3POOL deposit 61234.560000000000000000`  
  
Let's check how much CRV can we claim on gauge:  
`$ cceb eth tx CRV_GAUGE_3POOL claimable_tokens ETH-MY-ACC`  
  
Once we have enough let's claim CRV:  
`$ cceb eth tx CRV_TOKEN_MINTER mint CRV_GAUGE_3POOL`  
  
If you want to know the callable functions(abi) of CRV_TOKEN_MINTER, you can just add `--ls .` to the end of previous:  
`$ cceb eth tx CRV_TOKEN_MINTER mint CRV_GAUGE_3POOL --ls .`  
(Note if you use `--ls` then all the other function calls will be disregarded.)

Addresses are stored in two files:
- `config/secret/default.yaml` 
	- account addresses are stored here at `web3.account`. Importing accounts is not implemented. You have to edit the config file to add new accounts.
- `config/default.yaml`
	- token addresses are stored in 
		- `web3.mainnet.token` 
		- `web3.kovan.token` 
		- `web3.ropsten.token` 
	- contract addressses are stored in:
		- `web3.mainnet.<contract_group_name>` 
		- `web3.kovan.<contract_group_name>` 
		- `web3.ropsten.<contract_group_name>` 

Contracts are grouped in contract groups. Eg.: Makerdao contracts are grouped under `web3.mainnet.maker` contract group name.  
  
During importing smart contracts if a path is not specified (path tells cceb under which contract group a contract should be imported), then `cceb` will search for smart contract names that match until the first `_`. Eg: Curve smart contracts are stored under `web3.mainnet.curve` and all their names begin with `CRV_`, so if you import a smart contract with the name `CRV_TEST`, then it will automatically be appended to curve contract as its `CRV_` matches the `curve` contract group names.
  
If you want to import to a new path, you have to edit the config file manually to add new path, as adding path is not implemented yet.  
  
To import a token, the path must be specified. In most cases it will be `web3.mainnet.token`.

##### Examples

Import token (eg.: BZRX):  
`$ ./cceb eth import BZRX 0x56d811088235F11C8920698a204A5010a788f4b3 -l web3.mainnet.token`  

Import new Synthetics smart contract:
1. Edit config file and add `synthetics` contract group name under `web3.mainnet`:  
`vim config/default.yaml`  
2. Import Synthetics address resolver smart contract:  
`$ cceb eth import SYNTHETICS_ADDRESS_RESOLVER 0x823bE81bbF96BEc0e25CA13170F5AaCb5B79ba83 -l web3.mainnet.synthetics`

#### Interact with [Makerdao](https://www.makerdao.com)

Using `cceb` it is possible to manage Makerdao vaults. Vaults can be opened, can get info from, DAI be drawn, and debts can be paid back.

Amounts are expressed as 'normal' numbers. Eg.: if you type 1 for an Ether amount it does mean 1 Ether, and not 1e-18 Ether.

##### Examples

Open `ETH-A` vault for `ETH-SECOND-ACC`:  
`$ cceb eth maker open --from ETH-SECOND-ACC ETH-A`  
  
Deposit collateral of 10 Ether:  
`$ cceb eth maker deposit --from ETH-SECOND-ACC ETH-A 10`  
(Note we use normal number and not WEI for Ether amount)  
  
Generate 100 DAI:  
`$ cceb eth maker ETH-A 100 --from ETH-SECOND-ACC`  
  
Check if 100 DAI was indeed generated:  
`$ cceb eth tx DAI balanceOf ETH-SECOND-ACC`  
  
Get vault info:  
`$ cceb eth maker info ETH-A --from ETH-SECOND-ACC`  
  
Payback debt of 100 DAI:  
`$ cceb eth maker payback ETH-A 100`

#### [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com) interactions

`cceb` supports ledger for transaction signing. Message signing is not supported yet.

Ledger accounts that will be used with `cceb` must be imported manually to `config/secrets/default.yaml -> web3.account`. The example below shows a valid entry:  
```
	web3:
		account:
			ETH-LEDGER-0:
				address: '0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111'
				type: 'ledger'
```
